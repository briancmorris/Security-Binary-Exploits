## Level 1
### Vulnerability:
Can return into debug by buffer overflow, overwriting the frame pointer.
### Description
After logging into the ROP homework folder, I ran the server binary with port number '6969' in an SSH terminal like so:

```
bcmorri3@binhw-trusty-3:~/ROP/Level1$ ls
flag.txt  libc.so  rop1  server
bcmorri3@binhw-trusty-3:~/ROP/Level1$ ./server 6969
6969
```

I then logged into a local terminal, using the Windows Linux Subsystem to host a local ssh server, connected to the server running on the SSH terminal connected to the homework server like so:

```
ssh -L 5050:localhost:6969 -p 60047 bcmorri3@wtl.csc.ncsu.edu
The authenticity of host '[wtl.csc.ncsu.edu]:60047 ([152.14.93.39]:60047)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:60cfVx0inST/bEJ7MztBMM8NTCjCaZC0o5Dv0+wldIM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

This is because pwntools, the library used to use the exploit cannot SSH into multiple ports. I need to establish an SSH tunnel.

I used another SSH terminal to re-connect to the homework server and ran the rop1 binary with strace -f enabled. For the command I input "new", and then input 5,000 characters, and then input the "quit" command, segfaulting the program. I used the strace output to determine the memory address of the segfault at: 0x316a4130

Knowing this, I then used [this](https://projects.jason-rush.com/tools/buffer-overflow-eip-offset-string-generator/) website again to determine the number of characters that caused the segfault, revealing that 272 characters were overwritten before segfaulting. I then used objdump-d on rop1 to determine the address of debug was at: 080480d8. Finally, I had the necessary information to overwrite the frame pointer to return into debug!

I wrote a simple python script to perform the ROP attack, giving me shell access which I could use to retrieve the flag.

## Levels 2-4 were skipped for this assignment.
